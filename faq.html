<i style="color:purple"><b>What is the primary goal of DIY Bio?</b></i><p> 
Expanding science knowledge and disrupting the current stagnant science environment! Each member has their personal goals as well but we all plan on collectively advancing diybio as a community open lab and having people feel free and comfortable enough to walk in and try something! DIYBio.ot primarily provides the equipment and space while members invest their own in reagents and DNA pieces. People are free to work on their own projects whether it’s something they plan on commercializing or something that is done for fun!
<br><p>
<i style="color:purple"><b>Is it individuals working on their own projects, or is there some more large-scale collaborative project?</b></i><p> 
Yes, people work on their own projects! There are also collaborative projects involved as well! It really is up to the individual and membership does not depend on participation on any other lab project (if you like science you are in!).
<br><p>
<i style="color:purple"><b>What kinds of stuff can the bio lab "do"? (in layman's terms)</b></i><p>
We can grow bacteria, change their DNA, and make new things! So in this sounds scary but changing bacteria’s DNA is something the bacteria do themselves every 20 minutes. At the moment we can transform bacteria to smell like bananas, produce new proteins like blue color, make it respond to pH level changes, or salt content or whatever! All we need it the right protein (and grunt work). For the most part what we can do is limited. We do not work with animals or mammalian cells, only living thing we work with is K12 E. coli (a harmless lab variety of e coli. Its missing an essential gene which produces a necessary amino acid so it cannot survive out of our special cultures). We do not have any harmful/pathogenic genes. Against our ideology nor is it something we can order.

<br><p>
<i style="color:purple"><b>Are any safety precautions or risks associated with the work underway?</b></i><p>
BSL = biological safety level<br>
So yes we are all skilled! We have previous lab experience and have worked in higher BSL levelled labs which has extensive safety training (lots of time spent doing safety training). Anyone who is in-experienced is always supervised by someone who is and is advised accordingly. For the most part everything we have in the lab is pretty harmless. There are some things that will not be handled by others at all until they have the appropriate instruction and training such as out HCl, 95% ethanol and NaOH. For perspective though we have nothing that is any more dangerous than the stuff you can find in the darkroom or workshop. We are classified as a BSL1 lab (same BSL level as your everyday kitchen) which is defined as "...minimal potential hazard to individuals and community" Wiki page. We only work with bacteria and algae (no viruses, mammalian cells or anything pathogenic) and the biggest concern is contamination of experiments by the outside world. We still have safety rules and I attached a pdf of what they are.
